The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues remained suspended.  AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS  (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021)  OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS  1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the \"Committee\") authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market transactions (the \"Selected Bank\"), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee:  A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (\"Eligible Securities\") for the System Open Market Account (\"SOMA\"):  i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis (including such transactions as are commonly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or  ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Securities subject to an agreement to resell (\"repo transactions\") or to sell such Eligible Securities subject to an agreement to repurchase (\"reverse repo transactions\") for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties;  B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to mature without replacement;  C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and  D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency.  SECURITIES LENDING  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Securities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securities for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions).  A. Such securities lending must be:  i. At rates determined by competitive bidding;  ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program;  iii.

The Committee directs the Selected Bank to conduct testing of transactions for the purpose of operational readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization.  By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Program for Security of FOMC Information with minor technical changes.  In the Committee\\'s annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, all participants supported the statement as written, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision.  STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY  (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021)  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these disturbances. The Committee\\'s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average. Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past. Owing in part to the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased. The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee\\'s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve\\'s statutory mandate. The Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhance the Committee\\'s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. In order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.  Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee\\'s assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal. Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the Committee\\'s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee\\'s goals.  The Committee\\'s employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.  The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly every 5 years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments. The evolving outlooks for the path of the virus and for fiscal policy were the main drivers of financial markets over the intermeeting period. Progress on vaccinations had been slower than expected, and the near-term trajectory of the pandemic worsened, weighing on economic activity. However, even with the appearance of new strains of the virus, market confidence in the ultimate efficacy of the vaccination efforts seemed to remain high. The emergence of a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate bolstered investor expectations for additional fiscal stimulus, prompting upward revisions to forecasts for economic growth this year. In the Open Market Desk Survey of Primary Dealers, the median 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast rose about 1 percentage point.  Against this backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields rose notably over the period. Longer-dated real yields were lifted by expectations for improved growth and increased Treasury issuance, but remained deeply negative. Measures of inflation compensation increased over the period, with the five-year, five-year-forward measure rising to a level of around 2 percent. Overall financial conditions eased further, on net, as the recent rally in risk assets continued. Gains in U.S. equities again centered on cyclical sectors and smaller-capitalization firms most sensitive to growth. Credit spreads narrowed further, especially for riskier borrowers.  Expectations for the path of the target federal funds rate over the next several years, as implied by interest rate futures and by the Desk Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, were relatively little changed from December. The stability in near-term policy rate expectations amid an improving growth outlook appeared consistent with the Committee\\'s new framework and forward interest rate guidance. Al\\xadthough the median Desk survey respondent continued to expect 12‑month personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation of 2.3 percent when the FOMC first lifts the target range, the median expectation for the unemployment rate prevailing at that time was modestly lower than in December. The Desk survey results indicated that a majority of market participants anticipated that the pace of net asset purchases would remain stable for the remainder of the year and slow around the first quarter of 2022.  The manager next discussed conditions in funding markets. Over the year-end, overnight secured and unsecured rates were little changed at rates just below the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate even as financial firms managed their balance sheets for the reporting date. Going forward, reserves were projected to rise rapidly through the summer, reflecting ongoing Federal Reserve asset purchases as well as expected declines in balances held in the Treasury General Account. Market pricing suggested that the effective federal funds rate was expected to decline modestly through the second quarter. Even if more notable downward pressure on money market rates emerged, the manager anticipated that the Federal Reserve\\'s tools, including the IOER rate and overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, would continue to provide effective control over the federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates.  Finally, the manager discussed Desk operations. A range of indicators suggested that both fixed-income and funding markets continued to function smoothly over the period. The manager noted that, in the coming period, the Desk anticipated implementing two adjustments to continue to normalize operations. First, given the sustained stability in term repurchase markets, the Desk proposed discontinuing the weekly one-month term repurchase operations, beginning in mid-February. In addition, the Desk planned to reduce the frequency of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) operations in light of the sustained improvement in market conditions for these securities.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk\\'s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account during the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The COVID‑19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the January 26–27 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP had continued to advance in the fourth quarter of 2020, albeit at a pace that was markedly slower than the rapid rate seen in the third quarter, while the level of real GDP had not yet returned to the level seen before the onset of the pandemic. Labor market conditions deteriorated, on balance, in December, and employment continued to be well below its level at the start of 2020. Consumer price inflation through November—as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the PCE price index—remained considerably lower than the rates seen in early 2020.  Total nonfarm payroll employment fell in December, with especially sharp declines in the leisure and hospitality sector. As of December, payroll employment had retraced a little more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.7 percent in December. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined and the Hispanic unemployment rate rose; both rates remained well above the national average. However, the Asian unemployment rate moved below the national average in December. Both the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio were unchanged in December. Initial claims for unemployment insurance in mid-January were higher than their early December level. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP indicated that the four-week average change in private employment in mid-January was slightly lower than it had been in early December; however, the most recent week-to-week changes in this measure of payrolls had been highly volatile.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in December, a gain that was noticeably higher than the measure\\'s year‑earlier 12‑month change. The 12‑month change in average hourly earnings continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce, with the concentration of job losses among lower-wage workers over the pandemic period resulting in outsized increases in this measure of earnings that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions. By contrast, a staff measure of the 12‑month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data—a measure likely to have been less affected by changes in workforce composition—was 3-1/2 percent in December and remained well below its pre‑pandemic pace.  Total PCE price inflation was 1.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen over the first part of 2020. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while the trimmed mean measure of 12‑month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in November. In December, the 12‑month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.4 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations ticked higher. In the first part of January, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years moved back up to its late‑summer level, while in December, the 3‑year‑ahead measure of inflation expectations produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved back up to its August level.  Real PCE fell in November, and available indicators—including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE—pointed to a further decline in December. Housing starts and construction permits moved up in November and December and finished the year well above their pre‑pandemic levels. Al\\xadthough home sales turned down in November, the decline appeared to reflect limited availability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand.  Available indicators pointed to a strong increase in investment in equipment and intangibles in the fourth quarter of 2020, as this component of capital spending recovered from its sharp decline over the first half of the year. Likewise, drilling investment appeared to have turned up sharply, albeit from a low level, as oil prices moved higher. By contrast, investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector appeared to have declined further in the fourth quarter and had likely been restrained by firms\\' continued hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns.  Industrial production advanced further in the fourth quarter, led by a solid gain in manufacturing output, but had not yet overtaken its pre‑pandemic level. The low level of export demand since the onset of the pandemic had likely continued to restrain the recovery in the manufacturing sector; in addition, production of motor vehicles and parts was a small drag on manufacturing output in the fourth quarter as automotive producers appeared to have had difficulty getting assemblies fully under way for the new model year.  Total real government purchases appeared to have fallen further in the fourth quarter, though at a slower pace than in the third quarter. Available data suggested that real federal purchases had posted a modest gain, as an increase in defense purchases offset a reduction in nondefense purchases; however, indicators of real state and local purchases, including state and local government employment, pointed to a fourth-quarter decline similar in size to what had been seen in the third quarter.  The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened further in November. Both imports and exports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports rose in November to a level well above that of the previous January, with gains in most major categories. Al\\xadthough exports also grew in November, they had not yet recovered to their January 2020 level. Services trade continued a gradual rise but remained depressed, driven by the continued suspension of most international travel. Taken together, these data suggested that net exports made a significant negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  Recent data pointed to a sharp slowing in foreign economic growth in the fourth quarter, after a strong rebound in the third quarter. Amid a further intensification of the pandemic, many foreign governments tightened social-distancing restrictions. In a few countries, the emergence of new and more contagious virus strains was accompanied by a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The increased virus spread and restrictions appeared to take a toll on foreign economic activity, particularly in Europe. The global slowdown was most notable for services, with further declines in purchasing managers indexes for this sector through January in many advanced foreign economies. By contrast, manufacturing output in both advanced and emerging foreign economies continued to expand at a solid pace, supported by resilient demand for durable goods, high-tech goods, and medical supplies. Amid the generally weak economic situation, inflationary pressures remained subdued in most foreign economies.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Investor sentiment improved and risk asset prices moved higher over the intermeeting period on greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus. Domestic and foreign equity prices increased notably, and spreads on corporate and municipal bonds narrowed. The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened, partly reflecting an increase in inflation compensation. Market-based financing conditions remained accommodative, while bank lending conditions continued to be tight. However, a smaller net share of banks tightened lending standards than in previous quarters.  A straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond mid-2023 rose moderately over the intermeeting period, with the increases reportedly associated largely with greater investor optimism regarding the expected speed of the economic recovery. OIS quotes suggested that the expected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the third quarter of 2023, little changed from the time of the December meeting.  The yield on 2-year nominal Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeeting period, while the 10-year yield rose notably. Most of the steepening of the Treasury yield curve occurred following the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections, which reportedly bolstered market participants\\' expectations for additional fiscal stimulus. The FOMC\\'s updated guidance around asset purchases was seen as broadly in line with expectations and did not elicit noticeable financial market reaction. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased moderately, on net, continuing the upward trend observed over recent months, with the increase over the intermeeting period reportedly reflecting greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus and an associated improvement in the longer-run economic outlook.  Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted by gains in the share prices of banks and companies in more cyclically sensitive sectors, reportedly reflecting, in part, increased expectations of fiscal stimulus. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—was little changed, on net, remaining modestly elevated relative to its range over the past several years. Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat. Spreads on municipal bond yields narrowed notably in January, reportedly reflecting increased expectations of additional fiscal stimulus and aid to state and local governments.  Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, including over the year-end. Spreads for commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit across tenors were largely unchanged at historically low levels. Commercial paper outstanding declined somewhat in late December but quickly rebounded in early January to the levels observed before year-end. Amid stable market conditions, there was no take-up at the Commercial Paper Funding Facility or the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility over the intermeeting period. Assets under management (AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) remained stable over the intermeeting period. AUM of prime MMFs continued to decline, reaching the lowest level since late 2018, likely reflecting the compressed net yield advantage for prime funds relative to yields for government funds. The net yields of both prime and government MMFs remained near historically low levels.  The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate were little changed, averaging 9 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period. There continued to be no participation in the Fed\\'s repurchase agreement (repo) operations, and participation in the Fed\\'s reverse repo facility was minimal.  In foreign financial markets, the prospect of additional U.S. fiscal stimulus and the passage of key risk events such as the Brexit trade agreement largely outweighed investor concerns around new virus strains and the sluggish global vaccine rollout. On balance, foreign equity prices increased moderately, with notable outperformance in some Asian indexes, and capital inflows into mutual funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a robust pace. Longer-term sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies rose slightly on improved investor sentiment even while several major central banks reaffirmed their commitment to continue or possibly expand accommodative policies. The broad dollar index was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, while the Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar as data showed a robust economic recovery in China. Dollar funding conditions were generally stable around year-end.  Financing conditions in capital markets remained broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations. Gross corporate bond issuance was fairly strong in November and December, and seasoned and initial public offerings in the equity markets were robust. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance was also strong in December, as issuance volumes excluding refinancing topped their averages for previous months of 2020 and were above those observed during the same period of 2019.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances at banks continued to decline in December, albeit at a slower pace than in the fall. C&I loans declined in the fourth quarter because of weak origination activity, loan forgiveness at the Paycheck Protection Program, and continued repayments of bank debt. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks, on net, reported weaker demand and tightened lending standards for C&I loans, with notable differences in reported changes across bank sizes. Large banks reported having eased standards to large and middle-market firms, while, on net, banks of all sizes reported having tightened standards to small firms. However, a smaller net percentage of banks tightened lending standards to firms of all sizes than in previous quarters.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained stable in recent months after deteriorating substantially for several months following the onset of the pandemic. The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to slightly outpace upgrades in November and December, and the monthly volume of nonfinancial corporate bond defaults remained relatively low. Market indicators of future default expectations moved slightly lower, essentially returning to their pre-pandemic levels.  Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, but small business loan originations in November, the most recent month for which data were available, were at roughly the level seen a year earlier, likely supported by the refinancing of existing loans. Meanwhile, liquidity needs of small businesses remained high as businesses continued to operate at reduced capacity. Small business delinquency and default rates were little changed but remained elevated relative to the levels of recent years. Financing conditions in the municipal bond market remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period, and the credit quality of municipal debt remained roughly stable.  For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through capital markets, financing conditions remained generally accommodative, easing further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on agency CMBS ticked down, on net, and issuance remained elevated through December, al\\xadthough below its recent historical high in October. Risk spreads on triple-B non-agency CMBS declined, and spreads on triple-A non-agency CMBS stayed close to their historical lows. Issuance of non-agency CMBS remained somewhat below its pre-pandemic level. CRE bank loan growth remained weak in the fourth quarter amid depressed property transaction volumes. On net, in the January SLOOS, banks reported a further tightening of lending standards and further weakening in demand for CRE loans.  Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates ticked up slightly but stayed near historically low levels, supporting strong loan origination activity. Credit remained broadly available to higher-score borrowers seeking conforming mortgages but tightened further, from already tight levels, for borrowers with lower credit scores and those seeking nonconforming mortgages. The January SLOOS suggested that for most types of residential mortgages, banks\\' lending standards remained unchanged, while loan demand was either little changed or somewhat stronger. Mortgage forbearance rates plateaued in December and early January after having gradually declined over the previous six months, and the rate of new delinquencies stayed at low, pre-pandemic levels.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but tight for those with subprime scores. Banks in the January SLOOS reported easing standards for all consumer loan types and experiencing weaker demand for auto loans and little-changed demand for other consumer loans. Conditions in the asset-backed securities market appeared supportive of lending. Credit card balances edged down further for both prime and nonprime borrowers, likely reflecting weak consumer spending. However, the volume of new cards and available credit continued to rise for both prime and nonprime borrowers. Interest rates on new credit card offers for nonprime borrowers stayed elevated, and financing conditions remained tight for those borrowers. Auto loan balances continued to increase solidly for prime and near-prime borrowers but declined further for subprime borrowers. Auto loan interest rates were about flat over the past few months and remained significantly below their pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates for nonprime auto and credit card borrowers ticked up, albeit from very low levels.  The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff assessed asset valuation pressures as elevated. In particular, corporate bond spreads had declined to pre-pandemic levels, which were at the lower ends of their historical distributions. In addition, measures of the equity risk premium declined further, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Prices for industrial and multifamily properties continued to grow through 2020 at about the same pace as in the past several years, while prices of office buildings and retail establishments started to fall. The staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with household and business borrowing as notable, reflecting increased leverage and decreased incomes and revenues in 2020. Small businesses were hit particularly hard. The staff judged that vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage were moderate, noting that capital ratios at the largest bank holding companies rose over the course of last year; leverage among hedge funds was elevated but it did decline last spring for the most highly leveraged funds. The staff characterized vulnerabilities stemming from funding risks as moderate. Banks continued to maintain significant levels of high-quality liquid assets and stable sources of funding. In contrast, money market funds and open-ended mutual funds were characterized by significant vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation.  Staff Economic Outlook  The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting implied a considerably stronger outlook for activity in 2021 relative to the December forecast. Although incoming data had been weaker than expected, the staff\\'s January projection incorporated the effects of the stimulus in the recently enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA), together with an assumption that an additional sizable tranche of fiscal support would be put into place in coming months. Taken together, these stimulus measures were expected to partly offset the substantial drag on aggregate demand that would result from the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus enacted in the spring of 2020. The staff\\'s projection continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for an easing in social distancing in 2021. With the boost to growth from the reduction in social distancing assumed to be largely completed by the end of 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down over the remainder of the medium term. Even so, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate.  The 12‑month changes in total and core PCE prices in coming months were projected to briefly move above 2 percent in the second quarter of 2021 as the unusually low observations from the spring of 2020 drop out of the 12-month calculation. Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2 percent. Thereafter, inflation was projected to gradually edge up to 2 percent by the end of the medium term as labor and product markets tightened. With monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023.  The staff viewed the possibility that a larger-than-anticipated fiscal package would be enacted in coming months as a modest upside risk to the baseline economic outlook. However, the further rise in COVID‑19 cases in the United States, coupled with developments such as the emergence of more-contagious strains of the virus in the United States and elsewhere, led the staff to continue to judge that the risks to the baseline projection were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated.  Participants\\' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting the Federal Reserve\\'s actions to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook.  Participants observed that the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and associated social-distancing measures were restraining activity in some sectors, particularly in industries such as travel and leisure and hospitality. Most participants expected that the stimulus provided by the passage of the CAA in December, the likelihood of additional fiscal support, and anticipated continued progress in vaccinations would lead to a sizable boost in economic activity. Even so, participants noted that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with achieving maximum employment.  Participants commented on improved prospects for household spending over the course of the year, in part reflecting fiscal support. They saw progress on vaccinations as essential for supporting further gains in aggregate consumer spending and for the economic recovery more generally. In commenting on recent data for household spending, most participants discussed the composition of expenditures, with strong spending on many goods, especially durables, and weakness in spending on some services, especially in travel and in leisure and hospitality. The relative strength in consumer spending on goods was supported by fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits as well as by accommodative monetary policy. The weakness in services spending was largely attributed to the pandemic and associated social-distancing measures, which limited spending on services that depend heavily on in-person contact.  Increased government transfers to households, combined with reduced outlays on some services, had contributed to a historically large increase in aggregate household savings last year. Participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust; low interest rates were viewed as an important factor supporting the strength in housing activity.  Most participants noted that the economic downturn had not fallen equally on all Americans and that those least able to shoulder the burden—in particular, lower-income and Black and Hispanic households—had been the hardest hit by the pandemic. Many participants stressed that sustained support from fiscal policy would help address the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy could also help by promoting the economy\\'s return to maximum employment and price stability.  In their remarks on the business sector, participants commented that business equipment investment had continued to show strength while nonresidential construction remained weak. Participants also discussed the recent strong performance of the manufacturing sector. Many discussed supply chain issues in manufacturing, including those associated with acquiring material inputs and pandemic-related worker shortages and absenteeism. Business contacts reported that firms in goods-producing industries, particularly larger firms and those in the durable goods or housing sectors, were adapting to the pandemic; in contrast, smaller firms and those in industries most adversely affected by the pandemic were finding it more difficult to adapt. Many participants stated that their business contacts were optimistic that continued progress on vaccinations, together with further fiscal support, would result in more improvement in overall business conditions. Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues.  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed in recent months. Payroll employment fell in December, as continued job gains in many industries were outweighed by significant layoffs in industries where the resurgence of the virus had weighed heavily on activity. While labor market conditions had improved significantly, on balance, since the spring, some participants noted that if the sizable number of workers who reported having left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic were to be counted as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be substantially higher. Participants judged that the current low level of labor force participation likely reflected a number of factors, including health concerns and additional childcare responsibilities. Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. However, participants observed that the economy was far from achieving the Committee\\'s broad-based and inclusive goal of maximum employment and that even with a brisk pace of improvement in the labor market, achieving this goal would take some time.  In their comments about inflation, participants noted that headline PCE price inflation in December, measured on a 12-month basis, was poised to come in well below the Committee\\'s 2 percent longer-term objective. In the relatively near term, a number of participants suggested that there could be increases in the prices of some goods whose production has been subject to supply chain constraints, or soon could be; others anticipated that a possibly abrupt return to normal levels of activity could result in one-time increases in certain prices. Many participants stressed the importance of distinguishing between such one-time changes in relative prices and changes in the underlying trend for inflation, noting that changes in relative prices could temporarily raise measured inflation but would be unlikely to have a lasting effect. Some participants further observed that 12-month PCE inflation was likely to move somewhat above 2 percent for a brief period in the spring as the unusually low monthly observations from last spring roll out of the 12-month calculation. Outside of such near-term fluctuations, participants generally anticipated that inflation would move up along a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee\\'s objectives over time, supported by stronger economic activity, widespread vaccinations and the associated reduction in social distancing, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. Some participants pointed to the continued increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels recorded in the spring as consistent with the view that inflation was likely to move up gradually over time; others noted that survey-based measures were little changed, on net, over the year as a whole.  Participants noted that overall financial conditions remained highly accommodative, in part reflecting investors\\' optimism about the economic outlook along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and recent and expected future fiscal policy measures. However, a few participants remarked that credit conditions were relatively tight for borrowers with low credit scores and for some small and medium-sized businesses that rely on bank lending rather than capital markets to meet their financing needs.  While generally acknowledging that the medium-term outlook for real GDP growth and employment had improved, participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated. Participants agreed that the path of the economy depended significantly on the course of the virus and progress on vaccinations. Many participants remarked that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the economic outlook, including risks associated with new virus strains, potential public resistance to vaccination, and potential difficulties in the production and distribution of vaccines. With regard to upside risks, some participants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could turn out to be more expansionary than anticipated, that households could display greater willingness to spend out of accumulated savings than expected, or that widespread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employment than anticipated. Participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as having become more balanced than was the case over most of 2020, although most still viewed the risks as weighted to the downside. As an upside risk to inflation, several participants noted the potential for pandemic-related supply constraints to affect price inflation somewhat more than anticipated or for price increases among industries most adversely affected by the pandemic to be more pronounced than projected.  A number of participants commented on issues related to financial stability. Several participants noted areas of strength. For example, the banking system had shown considerable resilience since the onset of the pandemic. Banks\\' capital positions had generally remained solid, and earnings were strong. In addition, results from the most recent stress tests indicated that the largest banks could withstand very stressed economic conditions. That said, a few participants stated that it would be important to stay vigilant to ensure that the banking system remained strong and resilient. In addition, several participants noted that the pandemic had highlighted structural vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system. These included run-prone investment funds in short-term funding and credit markets as well as fragilities in Treasury market functioning; stresses stemming from these vulnerabilities had required substantial intervention by the Federal Reserve in the turbulent market conditions at the onset of the pandemic. A couple of participants commented that it would be important for the appropriate regulatory bodies to address these financial stability vulnerabilities. Regarding asset valuations, some participants commented that equity valuations had risen further, that initial public offering activity was elevated, or that valuations might have been affected by retail investors trading through electronic platforms. In addition, risk spreads on corporate bonds and loans were generally low, even with corporate indebtedness having risen to high levels. A few participants noted that some CRE in sectors that had been most directly affected by the pandemic—such as those involving retail establishments and hotels—faced the prospect of falling prices and increased stress.  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve\\'s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee\\'s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation. Participants noted that as the pandemic had worsened across the country in recent months, the pace of the recovery had moderated, with weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic. In contrast, participants remarked that the prospect of an effective vaccine program, the recently enacted fiscal support, and the potential for additional fiscal actions had led them to judge that the medium-term outlook had improved. That said, participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Committee\\'s longer-run goals and that the path ahead remained highly uncertain, with the pandemic continuing to pose considerable risks to the outlook.  In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy, participants judged that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy was essential to foster further economic recovery and to achieve an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time. Participants noted that economic conditions were currently far from the Committee\\'s longer-run goals and that the stance for policy would need to remain accommodative until those goals were achieved. Consequently, all participants supported maintaining the Committee\\'s current settings and outcome-based guidance for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases.  Participants noted that the Committee\\'s current guidance was well suited to the current environment because it describes how policy would respond based on the path of the economy. For example, if progress toward the Committee\\'s goals proved slower than anticipated, the outcome-based guidance would convey the Committee\\'s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet. In addition, participants noted that the Committee\\'s current outcome-based guidance for both the federal funds rate and balance sheet appeared to be well understood by the public. In that context, participants emphasized that it was important to abstract from temporary factors affecting inflation—such as low past levels of prices dropping out of measures of annual price changes or relative price increases in some sectors brought about by supply constraints or disruptions—in judging whether inflation was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  Participants noted that the increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet since last March had materially eased financial conditions and was providing substantial support to the economy. The Committee\\'s guidance for asset purchases indicated that asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until substantial further progress toward its employment and inflation goals had been achieved. With the economy still far from those goals, participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Various participants noted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that the pace of recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook.  Members agreed that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the outlook. Nonetheless, in light of the expected progress on vaccinations and the change in the outlook for fiscal policy, the medium-term prospects for the economy had improved enough that members decided that the reference in previous post-meeting statements to risks to the economic outlook over the medium term was no longer warranted.  Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee\\'s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.  All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee\\'s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee\\'s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee\\'s goals. Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:  \"Effective January 28, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:  \"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.

market committee for the period commencing january           and ending december     had been received and that the       named individuals had executed their oaths of office   the elected members and alternate members were as follows   william j  mcdonough  president of the federal reserve bank of new       york  with james h  oltman  first vice president of the federal       reserve bank of new york  as alternate   cathy e  minehan  president of the federal reserve bank of boston        with edward g  boehne  president of the federal reserve bank of       philadelphia  as alternate   michael

     city  with gary h  stern  president of the federal reserve bank       of minneapolis  as alternate   by unanimous vote  the following officers of the federal open       market committee were elected to serve until the election of their       successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee       after december     with the understanding that should they       discontinue their official connection with the board of governors or       with a federal reserve bank  they would cease to have any official       connection with the federal open market committee   by unanimous vote  the federal reserve bank of new york was       selected to execute transactions for the system open market account       until the adjournment of the first meeting of the committee after       december      by unanimous vote  peter r  fisher was selected to serve at       the pleasure of the committee as manager  system open market account        on the understanding that his selection was subject to being       satisfactory to the federal reserve bank of new york   secretary s note  advice subsequently was received         that the selection of mr  fisher was satisfactory to         the board of directors of the federal reserve bank of         new york   by unanimous vote  the minutes of the meeting of the federal       open market committee held on december     were approved   the manager of the system open market account reported on       developments in foreign exchange markets since the december meeting        there were no market transactions for system account during this       period  and thus no vote was required of the committee   the manager also reported on developments in domestic       financial markets and on system open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period       december     through january     by unanimous vote  the       committee ratified these transactions   the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and       financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the       intermeeting period ahead  a summary of the economic and financial       information available at the time of the meeting and of the       committee s discussion is provided below  followed by the domestic       policy directive that was approved by the committee and issued to the       federal reserve bank of new york   the information reviewed at this meeting suggested a strong       further rise in economic activity during the closing months of         although consumer spending appeared to be less buoyant and housing       demand had softened somewhat  growth in business investment  exports        and inventories remained brisk  industrial production and payroll       employment continued to record substantial gains  broad indexes of       prices for consumer goods and services had risen moderately on average       over recent months despite shrinking margins of unemployed resources       and further sizable increases in the prices of many materials   nonfarm payroll employment advanced considerably further in       december after a sharp rise in november  substantial job gains were       recorded in december in service industries and in the retail trade       sector  hiring in manufacturing was brisk for a third straight month        with labor demand especially strong in motor vehicles  capital goods        and electronic equipment  construction payrolls slipped after a large       increase in november  the average workweek was unchanged in december        but factory overtime edged back up  matching the highest level reached       in the history of this series  the civilian unemployment rate       declined to   percent   industrial production registered another large advance in       december  manufacturing accounted for all of the gain  an upturn in       mining production offset a decline in the output of utilities       associated with unseasonably warm weather  in manufacturing  the       output of motor vehicles and parts surged again and further solid       gains were recorded in the production of other goods  the large       advance in industrial output in december boosted rates of capacity       utilization above already high levels   retail sales were reported to have changed little over       november and december after substantial advances in september and       october  the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases       in outlays for non auto consumer goods  consumer spending on services       rose moderately on balance over november and december  with outlays       for energy services held down by unusually mild weather  although       some indicators of housing demand had weakened  housing starts posted       sizable gains on balance over november and december  single family       construction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in       mortgage rates in   and multifamily construction continued its       gradual recovery from the depressed levels of early   the       regional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather       accounted for little of the strength in december   business fixed investment was estimated to have grown at a       very rapid pace in the fourth quarter  with a pickup indicated for       business spending on both equipment and nonresidential structures        new orders for nondefense capital goods declined on balance over       november and december  but the large backlog of unfilled orders        especially for computers  pointed to a continued strong expansion in       spending on business equipment in coming months  nonresidential       construction activity was up considerably in november for a third       straight month  with increases in construction widespread by type of       structure  recent data indicated that permits for nonresidential       construction were continuing to trend higher and perhaps were running       ahead of construction activity   business inventory investment remained brisk in november  in       the aggregate  the buildup was in line with shipments and sales  in       manufacturing  stocks increased more rapidly in november  but the       ratio of stocks to shipments declined further and was at a       historically low level  in wholesale trade  inventories rose less       rapidly in november  but the inventory to sales ratio increased       further  although it remained within its range of recent years        inventory accumulation slowed a little at the retail level  and the       inventory to sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of       its range of recent years   the nominal deficit on u s  trade in goods and services       widened somewhat further in november  and for october and november       combined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third       quarter  the value of exports of goods and services increased more       slowly in the october november period than in the third quarter        largely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies        the rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the       october november period was led by increased imports of non oil       industrial supplies and automotive  capital  and consumer goods        available data for the fourth quarter of  indicated continued       growth in economic activity  though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace        in the major foreign industrial countries   consumer price inflation slowed a little in december despite       a jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in       energy prices  excluding food and energy items  consumer prices edged       up in december and rose significantly less in  than in   at       the producer level  prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly       in december  with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food       prices  prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased       modestly in  after being held down in  by a sharp drop in the       prices of tobacco products  in contrast to prices of finished goods        price inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in         for intermediate goods other than food and energy items  prices rose       at a faster rate in the second half of   with the pickup most       clearly evident in materials used in manufacturing  prices of crude       materials rose rapidly in the second half of  and for the year as       a whole  increases in labor costs remained moderate  average hourly       earnings were little changed on balance over november and december        and for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in         more broadly  hourly compensation of private industry workers       increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the       previous three quarters of   and the rise for the year was       significantly less than in    at its meeting on december     the committee adopted a       directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure       on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible       firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period        accordingly  the directive stated that in the context of the       committee s long run objectives for price stability and sustainable       economic growth  and giving careful consideration to economic        financial  and monetary developments  somewhat greater reserve       restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint       might be acceptable during the intermeeting period  the reserve       conditions associated with this directive were expected to be       consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over       coming months   open market operations during the intermeeting period were       directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve       positions  with the need for seasonal credit diminishing over the       period  adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended lower but averaged       a little above anticipated levels  near year end  the trading desk       accommodated heavy demands for reserves through system rps  the       federal funds rate averaged close to    percent during the       intermeeting period   most other market interest rates declined slightly on balance       over the period after the december  meeting  very short term       interest rates fell after the first of the year  reflecting the       disappearance of year end premiums  more broadly  favorable news on       inflation and indications of some unexpected slowing in the growth of       final demands apparently led market participants to conclude that       further tightening of monetary policy  though still expected to be       substantial  would be less than previously thought and would be spread       over a longer period  yields on tax exempt instruments declined       considerably as concerns about the implications of orange county s       problems for the financial condition of other municipal governments       abated  strong earning reports for the fourth quarter boosted major       indexes of equity prices   in foreign exchange markets  the trade weighted value of the       dollar in terms of the other g  currencies declined somewhat over       the intermeeting period  the dollar fell substantially against the       mark  which was buoyed by safe haven inflows from weaker european       currencies  but dropped less against the yen  one factor that weighed       against the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the u s        economy of the sharp depreciation of the mexican peso and the related       economic and financial problems in mexico and other developing       economies  market participants expressed some concern that the crisis       might constrain u s  monetary policy in the event of further domestic       inflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective       reduction in the mexican current account deficit would lie importantly       in the already substantial u s  deficit   growth of  and  strengthened in december  and data for       the first half of january suggested a further acceleration in that       month  much of the pickup in  in december was due to rapid       expansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight       eurodollars  which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts       associated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by       shifting funds into market instruments  the faster growth of        reflected  in addition to the acceleration of its  component  bank       use of large cds and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively       robust demands for credit  from the fourth quarter of  to the       fourth quarter of    grew at the lower end of the committee s       range for  and  in the lower half of its range  total domestic       nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent       months  and for  it was in the lower half of its monitoring range   the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that       growth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next       several quarters and for some period thereafter would average less       than the rate of increase in the economy s potential output  consumer       spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be       restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes  the satisfaction of       pent up demands  and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on       the demand for durable goods  business outlays for new equipment were       expected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing       costs and slower growth of sales and profits  homebuilding was       anticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs       and income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage       rates  recent developments in mexico were expected to cut into       exports in the near term  but the sustained economic growth elsewhere       would keep export demand on an uptrend  although there was       considerable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook  in light of the       congressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast       incorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had       been built into recent forecasts  in the staff s judgment  the       economy currently was operating beyond its long run  noninflationary       capacity  and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could       ratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions   in the committee s discussion of current and prospective       economic developments  the members agreed that growth in economic       activity could be expected to moderate considerably over the course of         although inflation was likely to be higher than in   they       acknowledged that their current projections were subject to       substantial risks  the expansion continued to display appreciable       momentum and signs of slower growth were still quite limited and       tentative  even so  the members remained persuaded that the lagged       effects of the policy tightening implemented over the course of        would become increasingly evident in interest sensitive sectors of the       economy as the year progressed  the projected moderation in the       growth of final demands  which probably would be concentrated at least       initially in the housing and consumer durables sectors  would       undoubtedly reinforce an expected cutback in inventory investment from       its unsustainable pace in recent quarters  a key uncertainty in the       outlook was whether the slowing in overall economic growth would be       sufficient to relieve the current pressures on labor and other       producer resources  which many members saw as portending higher       inflation  or  indeed  whether such pressures would intensify further        opinions differed to some degree with regard to both the likely extent       of the prospective slowing in economic growth and the outlook for       inflation  however  most of the members concluded that some rise in       inflation appeared probable over coming quarters  and they were       concerned that this upturn would not be reversed and could be extended       in the absence of further monetary restraint   in keeping with the practice at meetings when the committee       establishes its long run ranges for growth of the money and debt       aggregates  the members of the committee and the federal reserve bank       presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual       projections of economic activity  the rate of unemployment  and       inflation for the year   measured from the fourth quarter of        to the fourth quarter of   their forecasts of the growth in real       gdp had a central tendency of  to  percent  compared with a growth       rate of  percent estimated for   most of the members also       anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would       be associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their       projections of the rate in the fourth quarter of  were centered in       a narrow range around    percent  the high levels of resource       utilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members       as likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices        accordingly  projections of the rate of inflation  as indexed by the       consumer price index  had a central tendency of  to    percent for       the period from the fourth quarter of  to the fourth quarter of         compared with rates of about    percent in both  and          in their review of regional economic developments  members       referred to widespread evidence of further growth in business       activity  but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some       softening in a few areas or industries  several emphasized  however        that the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant       moderation in the overall growth of the economy  with regard to       financial conditions  members commented that they saw little       indication that policy tightening actions over the past year were       constraining the availability of credit to any observable degree        despite higher interest rates  financial conditions remained broadly       supportive of further economic expansion  the performance of stock       market prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt       markets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among       investors  members also took note of the accommodative lending       policies of banking institutions  those policies had encouraged rapid       growth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing       to the ongoing strength of the economic expansion  some members       expressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their       lending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their       loan portfolios   in their assessment of developments in key sectors of the       economy  members referred to the sluggish behavior of non auto retail       sales in november and december  but they also noted that the available       information on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this       year was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a       slowing trend  anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed  and       evidence of some decline in january sales of motor vehicles needed to       be evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new       reporting method  consumer confidence was at a high level  but some       members observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was       likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point        in this regard  however  it was pointed out that rising consumer       incomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly       thus far  on balance  the members believed that the growth in       consumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though       such spending might be relatively well maintained for some period        given the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready       availability of financing to many consumers  in any event  the       outlook for this sector of the economy  which was critical to any       significant moderation in overall economic growth  was uncertain with       regard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing   housing construction was cited as potentially the most       important demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute       to more moderate economic growth over the year ahead  as evidenced by       nationwide data through the end of   single family housing starts       had held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home       mortgage rates  but anecdotal reports from around the country had       pointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and       continued to do so  against the background of current mortgage rate       levels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness        the members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing  at       least in the single family sector  the mild uptrend in the much       smaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period        given low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas  and further       improvement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to       some extent the overall slowing in housing construction   in the capital goods sector  real business fixed investment       had strengthened further in the fourth quarter  and the members       believed  on the basis of rising order backlogs and the strength of       permits for new business construction  that considerable momentum had       carried into this year  while the growth in spending for business       equipment undoubtedly would moderate from its extraordinary pace over       an extended period  large business profits and the still relatively       low user cost of capital would tend to support appreciable further       growth in such investment in the context of elevated levels of       capacity utilization and ongoing efforts  induced by strong market       competition  to increase productivity  moreover  nonresidential       construction was now trending higher  with particular strength evident       in industrial and commercial construction   the pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was       viewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen       as likely over the forecast horizon  though the precise timing and       extent were impossible to predict  while slower growth in final       demand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp       adjustment in inventory investment  members cited factors that could       mute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall gdp        these included relatively low inventory sales ratios across much of       the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended       inventory accumulation  moreover  because an unusually large share of       the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports        a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller than usual       impact on domestic production  there was no current evidence that       inventory investment was slowing  and indeed recent data on business       loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory       accumulation since the beginning of the year  nonetheless  as more       moderate growth in final demand began to emerge  concerns about the       availability of materials used in the production process or stocks       needed to meet market demand should diminish  and business firms could       be expected to trim their demand for inventories  perhaps aggressively       for a time  indeed  this sector of the economy might well account for       much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during       the year ahead   fiscal policy was under active debate in the congress  and       the members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain  the       emergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a       reasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts  albeit an       assumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error  in any       event  any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely       to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps       also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets   developments in mexico and their possible repercussions in       other developing nations had negative implications for u s  exports        at least over the short run  indeed  some members cited anecdotal       evidence that reduced trade with mexico had already emerged since late         moreover  the effects of the earthquake in kobe  japan  seemed       to be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk       goods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term  looking       beyond the months immediately ahead  the relatively robust growth       projected for many industrial countries together with the lower value       of the dollar should boost the nation s overall external trade       balance  though probably not to the extent of providing substantial       stimulus to the economy  one member observed that a number of       countries throughout the world faced the potential for important       changes in political conditions that could have adverse effects on       their growth and trading relationships  with possible repercussions on       u s  exports   members commented that the strong growth in economic activity       and high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid       increases in the prices of many raw materials and semi finished goods       used in the production process  but contrary to numerous forecasts       these developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation       as measured by the prices of final goods and services  this favorable       development might be explained in part by lags in the inflation       transmission process and perhaps to some degree by various structural       changes and productivity improvements in recent years that may have       raised both the level and the rate of increase of the economy s       potential for sustained activity  many members observed  however        that it would not be prudent from a monetary policy standpoint to       assume that continued rapid economic growth and further pressures on       producer resources would not lead to rising inflation over the       quarters ahead  while competitive pressures still generally limited       the extent to which business firms could pass through rising costs of       raw materials and other producer inputs to the prices of final goods        the members referred to increasingly numerous examples of successful       efforts to raise such prices and to apparently growing business       expectations that it would be possible to implement such increases       over the months ahead  on balance  the members generally were       persuaded that the economy had attained levels of labor and capital       utilization that implied a strong risk of rising inflation over coming       quarters   in keeping with the requirements of the full employment and       balanced growth act of   the humphrey hawkins act   the committee       at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and       debt aggregates in  that it had established on a tentative basis       at its meeting in july   the tentative ranges included expansion       of  to  percent for  and  to  percent for   measured from the       fourth quarter of  to the fourth quarter of   the monitoring       range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set       provisionally at  to  percent for   the ranges for  and        were unchanged from those that the committee had used in   while       the range for debt was one percentage point lower   all the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the ranges that       the committee had set on a tentative basis in july   while some       acceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the       pace in  could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a       staff analysis  monetary expansion within the ranges in question       appeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of       nominal gdp that the members were projecting for  and that they       viewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation  moreover  the       ranges for the broad monetary aggregates had been reduced over the       past decade to levels that  notably in the case of   should now be       consistent over long periods with the committee s objectives for       stable prices and maximum sustainable economic growth  this outcome       would depend on the restoration over time of the historical velocity       patterns linking the monetary aggregates to broad measures of economic       performance  including a level velocity trend for   it was noted in       this regard that until recent years the growth of  had tended to       exceed that of   a pattern that seemed to be re emerging  and       therefore a somewhat higher range might be set for  than for         however  the members did not believe that a persuasive argument could       be made at this juncture for raising the  range  though they did not       want to rule out the option of doing so later  possibly when the       ranges were reviewed at midyear  indeed  to make the change at this       point might convey a misleading message regarding the committee s       policy intentions or its confidence in prospective monetary growth       relationships   the committee also considered the potential advantages and       disadvantages of setting specific targets for bringing inflation down       and achieving price stability over time  such targets might provide       an alternative or supplemental approach to the monetary growth ranges        which had been found to be unreliable guides for monetary policy over       the past several years  the members discussed a number of aspects of       inflation targeting  on the one hand  such targeting would help to       anchor the conduct of monetary policy and progress in meeting these       objectives could enhance the credibility of the federal reserve and       perhaps reduce the overall cost of attaining price stability  on the       other hand  close adherence to preset inflation targets could unduly       constrain the federal reserve in its efforts to counteract the effects       of cyclical shortfalls in the performance of the economy  the members       agreed that the discussion had been helpful in outlining the issues       and that the subject should be revisited  it was noted in this       connection that the committee might be asked to comment during the       months ahead on specific congressional proposals for inflation       targeting   at the conclusion of its discussion  all the members voted to       approve without change the tentative ranges for  that the       committee had established in july of last year  in keeping with its       usual procedures under the humphrey hawkins act  the committee would       review its ranges at midyear  or sooner if interim conditions       warranted  in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the       aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments        accordingly  the following longer run policy statement for  was       approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive   the federal open market committee seeks monetary         and financial conditions that will foster price         stability and promote sustainable growth in output  in         furtherance of these objectives  the committee at this         meeting established ranges for growth of  and  of          to  percent and  to  percent respectively          measured from the fourth quarter of  to the fourth         quarter of   the committee anticipated that money         growth within these ranges would be consistent with its         broad policy objectives  the monitoring range for         growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered         to  to  percent for the year  the behavior of the         monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in         the light of progress toward price level stability          movements in their velocities  and developments in the         economy and financial markets

action  none   in the committee s discussion of policy for the intermeeting       period ahead  all the members indicated that they could support some       firming in reserve conditions  though a few preferred to delay such an       action pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant       new information that could help the committee to evaluate whether and       to what extent the economic expansion might be slowing  most of the       members were convinced  however  that current monetary policy should       be adjusted promptly to a more clearly restrictive stance  in their       view  prompt action was needed to counter inflationary pressures and       inflationary expectations in an economy that already seemed to be       operating at  and perhaps beyond  sustainable capacity levels and to       be continuing to expand at a pace above its long run potential  in       these circumstances  a delay in tightening policy would incur an       unacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop       in the economy and would require more tightening over time than might       otherwise be needed to achieve the committee s objectives  part of       the risk involved a potential further decline in the dollar at a time       when there already was considerable concern about rising pressures on       prices  some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally       anticipated in markets  and a failure to take action now was likely in       the view of a number of members to raise questions about the       credibility of the system s anti inflation resolve and to generate       some unsettlement in financial markets  notably in the foreign       exchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to       further weakness  in terms of balancing the policy risks that were       involved  a prompt move would provide some insurance against what       these members viewed as the principal risk in current circumstances  that of rising inflation  the risks of excessive tightening  while       not completely absent  were believed to be limited in light of the apparent strength and momentum of the expansion  which many       forecasters had underestimated over the past year  one member       expressed the view that while monetary growth had been damped        continuing restraint on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates       was desirable to offset a previous build up in liquidity and help       assure that inflationary pressures would be contained   members who saw an advantage in postponing a decision to       tighten policy commented that  in light of some scattered signs of a       moderating expansion  it would be helpful to wait for certain key       statistics that would become available within the next few weeks to       judge the extent of any moderation  data on retail sales in january       might provide particular insights as to whether the softening in such       sales in november and december was persisting  the favorable news on       inflation in the fourth quarter had lessened concerns about an       immediate inflation threat  and if the incoming information confirmed       the need for further tightening  the short delay in implementing it       would have only a minimal cost  in addition  an increase in monetary       restraint would be likely to exacerbate the problems of mexico and       perhaps to some extent those of canada and would have potentially       adverse implications for u s  trade with both of these key trading       partners  because the probability that incoming information would       counsel against any further policy tightening was certainly less than        percent so that only a matter of timing was likely to be involved        these members indicated that they would join with the other members in       voting to tighten policy at this meeting   concerning the possible need to adjust policy during the       intermeeting period  the members were unanimously in favor of adopting       a symmetric directive  given a decision to implement some tightening       in monetary policy at this meeting  they did not believe that there       should be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this       period  a number of members observed that further monetary restraint       might not be needed if  in line with their expectations  the incoming       evidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the       expansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a       growth path consistent with containing inflation pressures  in any       event  the committee s most difficult decision over the next several       quarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening       was no longer desirable   prior to the end of the meeting  the members were apprised of       a disposition on the part of the board of governors to approve an       increase of   percentage point in the discount rate that was pending       at several federal reserve banks  in the event that such an increase       was approved by the board  the members agreed that open market       operations should be conducted so as to allow that increase to be       reflected fully in reserve markets   at the conclusion of the committee s discussion  all the       members indicated that they could support a directive that called for       increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions  in       the implementation of this policy  account would be taken of a       possible increase of   percentage in the discount rate that was       under consideration by the board of governors  the members also       agreed that the directive should not include any presumption about       possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period        accordingly  in the context of the committee s long run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth  and giving careful       consideration to economic  financial  and monetary developments  the       committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve       restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period        according to a staff analysis  the reserve conditions contemplated at       this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in  and        over coming months   at the conclusion of the meeting  the federal reserve bank of       new york was authorized and directed  until instructed otherwise by       the committee  to execute transactions in the system account in       accordance with the following domestic policy directive   the information reviewed at this meeting         suggests a strong further rise in economic activity         during the closing months of   nonfarm payroll         employment was up considerably further in december         after a sharp increase in november  and the         civilian unemployment rate declined to   percent          industrial production registered another large         advance in december and capacity utilization         continued to move up from already high

members who voted to approve these proposals were persuaded       that the nature and severity of mexico s financial problems could not       be contained without making available substantial financial assistance       to the government of mexico  the financial support provided by the       united states would be accompanied by similar assistance from the imf       and would be conditioned on mexico s commitment to implement major       changes in its economic policies  including monetary policy  it was       emphasized during the committee s discussion that the united states       had a strong interest in encouraging the restoration of stability in       mexico for numerous reasons  including the growth of trade between the       two nations and the resulting creation of jobs in both countries        moreover  mexico s financial problems appeared to be spreading to a       number of other nations and adversely affecting the dollar in the       foreign exchange markets  the participation of the federal reserve in       this effort was strongly endorsed by the administration and the       overall program had the support of the bipartisan leadership in the       congress  apart from temporary financial resources  the federal       reserve was in a position to supply expertise and experience that were       not readily available elsewhere  on the negative side  the members       acknowledged that there could be no assurances that the rescue program       would succeed  but its scale  its multinational character  and the       apparent willingness of mexican officials to pursue the difficult       policies needed to assure success were grounds for optimism   messrs  lindsey and melzer dissented with respect to       increases in both the swap line and the warehousing arrangement with       the exchange stabilization fund  they did not believe that the       committee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether       developments in mexico threatened u s  financial stability  a possible       justification for increased central bank lending on a short term       basis  furthermore  they considered it inappropriate for the federal       reserve to participate  directly or indirectly  in intermediate to       long term financing to facilitate debt restructuring  they were       concerned that such participation in a fiscal policy matter might       compromise  or appear to compromise  the independence of the monetary       policy process  mr  lindsey added that the latter risks were       significantly enhanced given the absence of congressional       authorization or more general public support for these measures   disclosure policy   at this meeting  the committee decided to retain the procedures that it had followed over the past year for providing greater       information to the public about its policy actions and discussions        it was the judgment of the members that these procedures strike an       appropriate balance between making the committee s decisions and       deliberations accessible to the public as soon and as fully as       feasible  while safeguarding the committee s flexibility in policymaking and preserving an unfettered deliberative process  the       procedures in question involve the prompt announcement of the       committee s decisions and the release of minutes and transcripts of       fomc meetings   the committee will continue its practice of announcing each       change in the stance of monetary policy in a press release on the day       the decision is made  this practice removes any uncertainty about the       committee s intentions in regard to reserve conditions and enables all       financial market participants and others to receive the information at       the same time  when no change is made at a meeting  the committee       normally will announce only the time when the meeting ended and that       there are no further announcements  however  in some infrequent       circumstances  the committee may decide to issue a statement even when       no change in policy is made   the full substance of the committee s deliberations relating       to each policy decision will continue to be reported  as is the       current practice  in comprehensive minutes of the meeting that are       released two or three days following the next regularly scheduled       meeting  for historians and other students of monetary policymaking        those minutes will be supplemented by lightly edited transcripts of       the discussion at each committee meeting  for recent and future       meetings  transcripts for an entire year will be released with a five year lag  earlier transcripts dating back to march  will continue       to be released on an ongoing basis as the light editing process is       completed  continuing the practice followed since the beginning of         transcripts prepared by the committee s secretariat will be       circulated to each participant to verify his or her comments  and only       changes that clarify meaning  such as the correction of grammar or       transcription errors  will be permitted  a limited amount of material       will be withheld from the publicly released version of these       documents  primarily to protect the confidentiality of foreign and       domestic sources of information that likely would be lost if the       information they provide were to be made public  as required by law        a complete  unredacted version of the transcript of each meeting will       be turned

board  andrei zlate  group manager  division of monetary affairs  board  developments in financial markets and open market operations  the manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period  u s  financial conditions tightened over the period  largely reflecting an upward revision in investors  outlook for the path of the policy rate  treasury yields climbed substantially  with most of the upward move reflected in real yields  equity prices initially rose amid second quarter earnings reports that were better than feared but later retraced those gains in response to the shifting policy outlook  regarding international developments  yields in most advanced foreign economies  afes  also rose sharply as a number of other central banks lifted policy rates and indicated in their communications that they would likely continue to tighten monetary policy in order to address inflation pressures  the exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably  reaching multidecade highs in real terms  as market participants perceived mounting economic challenges abroad   the market implied path of the federal funds rate shifted sharply higher after market participants interpreted federal reserve communications—particularly those provided at the jackson hole symposium—along with incoming data  as indicating a more restrictive path of policy than previously expected  policy sensitive rates suggested that a  basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was widely expected to be decided on at the committee s september meeting  with some chance of a  basis point move  in addition  the market implied path suggested reasonable odds of additional  basis point and  basis point rate increases at the november and december meetings  respectively  market participants generally anticipated a further slowing in the pace of rate increases after december  with the peak policy rate being reached in the first half of   beyond that period  the market implied path of the federal funds rate sloped downward  likely reflecting downside risks to the policy rate path  the median respondent to the open market desk surveys expected the policy rate path to remain flat through  after the peak rate was reached  on average  desk survey respondents assigned an almost  percent probability to a decline in real gross domestic product  gdp  over   nearly double the probability assigned in the july survey   the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of policy implementation  balance sheet runoff had continued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period  with caps on redemptions of treasury securities and agency mortgage backed securities  mbs  doubling in september  the pace of balance sheet runoff was set to increase over coming months  the markets for treasury securities and agency mbs continued to function in an orderly manner  though liquidity conditions in both markets remained low  reflecting elevated interest rate uncertainty   in money markets  the  basis point increase in the target range at the july meeting passed through fully to overnight rates  amid strong demand for short term investments  take up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement  on rrp  facility was relatively steady at elevated levels   the staff continued to anticipate that on rrp take up would decline in coming quarters from its currently elevated levels as money market participants responded to shifting conditions  issuance of short term securities was likely to increase in coming periods  and  as more clarity emerged in the economic and policy outlook  demand for short term assets could moderate  both of these developments would ease downward pressure on yields on safe short term investments  the gradual reduction in on rrp balances could also be facilitated by rising competition among banks in seeking deposits  the manager pro tem indicated that the staff would continue to monitor money market developments closely in order to assess whether any frictions were emerging in this process   the manager pro tem concluded with an update on operational matters  as expected  federal reserve net income turned negative in september  the staff expected that the size of the associated deferred asset would increase over time until net income turned positive  likely in a few years  the desk planned to begin aggregation of those agency mbs held in the system open market account  soma  that are not eligible to be commingled into uniform mbs and  specifically  the freddie mac mbs that were issued before june  and have a  day payment delay  decisions about any additional aggregations would be made at a later date   by unanimous vote  the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period  there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period   staff review of the economic situation  the information available at the time of the september – meeting suggested that u s  real gdp was increasing at a modest pace in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year  labor demand remained strong  and the labor market continued to be very tight  recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflation—as measured by the  month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures  pce —remained elevated   total nonfarm payroll employment posted robust gains in july and august at an average pace that was only slightly below what was seen over the first half of the year  the unemployment rate edged up  on net  from   percent in june to   percent in august  the unemployment rate for african americans increased over this period  while the rate for hispanics moved up slightly on net  both rates were noticeably higher than the national average  the labor force participation rate and employment to population ratio both rose  on net  from june to august  the private sector job openings rate  as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey  moved slightly lower from may to july but remained at a high level  nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based  average hourly earnings rose   percent over the  months ending in august  while the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector  which also includes benefit costs  rose   percent over the  months ending in june    percentage points faster than the year earlier pace   consumer price inflation remained elevated  total pce price inflation was   percent over the  months ending in july  and core pce price inflation  which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices  was   percent over the same period  the trimmed mean measure of ‑month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was   percent in july  in august  the ‑month change in the consumer price index  cpi  was   percent  while core cpi inflation was   percent over the same period  survey based measures of short run inflation expectations declined in recent weeks  while measures of longer term inflation expectations remained roughly stable or moved lower   available spending indicators  including the august retail sales report  suggested that real pce was on track to post a modest gain in the third quarter  however  the latest housing market data pointed to another sharp contraction in residential investment in the third quarter  and business fixed investment appeared to be rising at a tepid pace   real goods exports stepped up in june and then rose further in july  led by increases in exports of industrial supplies  by contrast  real goods imports stepped down in june and then fell sharply in july  driven by a large decline in consumer goods imports  exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel  the nominal u s  international trade deficit continued to narrow in june and july  altogether  net exports contributed positively to gdp growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter   data pointed to weak foreign growth in recent months  weighed down by the global reverberations from russia s war against ukraine and a loss of momentum in the chinese economy  in europe  further disruptions to the supply of energy exacerbated declines in real disposable incomes and in consumer and business confidence  restraining economic activity  in china  recent indicators suggest only a partial rebound from the effects of earlier severe covid  related lockdowns as well as increasing concerns about the property sector  weaker growth in china and the broader global economy also weighed on export oriented emerging market economies in asia  consumer price inflation rose further in august in many foreign economies  reflecting past increases in energy and food prices  but also a continued broadening of inflationary pressure to core prices  with inflation persistently high  many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy   staff review of the financial situation  over the intermeeting period  u s  treasury yields and the market implied federal funds rate path moved higher  broad domestic equity price indexes decreased slightly  on balance  but market volatility remained elevated  credit remained widely available to most types of borrowers  but increases in borrowing costs appeared to damp the demand for credit in some markets in recent months  measures of current loan performance for businesses and most households remained generally stable  however  more recently  expectations of future credit quality for businesses deteriorated slightly  and delinquency rates rose for some types of credit owed by households with low credit scores   the expected path of the federal funds rate—implied by a straight read of financial market quotes—rose in the period since the july fomc meeting  largely reflecting more restrictive than expected monetary policy communications amid stronger than expected economic data and ongoing concerns about high inflation  on net  nominal treasury yields increased significantly across the maturity spectrum  the increases in nominal treasury yields were primarily accounted for by rising real yields  while inflation compensation measures declined substantially at short horizons and remained relatively little changed at medium  and longer term horizons   broad equity price indexes decreased slightly  on net  as substantial early gains arising from investors  improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better than feared second quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected  one‑month option implied volatility on the s p —the vix—increased somewhat  on net  and remained elevated by historical norms  partly reflecting investor uncertainty and risks associated with higher inflation and the expected move to a restrictive policy stance  corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly  on net  and remained roughly at the midpoints of their historical distributions  reflecting increases in both policy rates and corporate bond spreads  yields on corporate bonds rose significantly since the start of the year  municipal bond spreads over comparable maturity treasury yields widened a touch   conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period  with the july increase in the federal reserve s administered interest rates passing through quickly to other money market rates  although secured overnight rates firmed slightly later in the intermeeting period  they remained soft relative to the on rrp offering rate—a configuration that market participants attributed to relatively low treasury bill supply combined with strong investor demand for short dated instruments amid uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate  consistent with continued softness in repurchase agreement rates  daily take up in the on rrp facility remained elevated  spreads on lower rated short term commercial paper changed little on net  bank deposit rates continued to increase modestly in august  following a lagged response to increases in the federal funds rate  while money market mutual funds  net yields rose along with the increases in short term rates   sovereign yields in most afes rose notably over the intermeeting period as major central banks raised their policy rates and communicated a tighter stance of future policy in the face of persistent inflationary pressures  yields on japanese government securities  however  ended the period little changed  as the bank of japan reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance  measures of foreign inflation compensation were volatile amid large swings in european natural gas prices but increased moderately on net  the u s  dollar appreciated further against most major currencies  reaching multi decade highs against the euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen  the dollar s strength largely reflected increasing investor concerns about the global growth outlook as well as widening interest rate differentials between the united states and japan  growth concerns also weighed on foreign equity prices  which declined moderately  outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a modest pace  and credit spreads in emerging market economies narrowed somewhat on net   in domestic credit markets  borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period  yields on both corporate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased  bank interest rates for commercial and industrial  c i  and commercial real estate  cre  loans also increased  among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis  the share of firms facing higher borrowing costs continued to climb through august  municipal bond yields increased across ratings categories  borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased and reached their highest levels since   interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher  in line with the rise in the federal funds rate  and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through august   credit remained generally available to businesses and households  but high borrowing costs appeared to reduce the demand for credit  resulting in lower financing volumes in some markets  issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds slowed further in july from the weak levels seen in the second quarter but rebounded somewhat in august and so far in september  gross institutional leveraged loan issuance increased modestly in july from subdued levels but continued to be weak in august  equity issuance remained depressed  while issuance of municipal bonds was sluggish over the summer and so far in september   according to the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices  banks tightened credit standards on c i lending for the first time in two years  but c i loans on banks  balance sheets expanded at a strong pace in july and august  reflecting strong demand from nonfinancial businesses  cre loans on banks  balance sheets also continued to grow robustly  but issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities  cmbs  slowed in july from its strong pace earlier in the year  credit availability to small businesses appeared to be tightening somewhat  the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain loans continued its upward trend in august but remained lower than its historical average   credit in the residential mortgage market remained available for high credit score borrowers  credit availability for low credit score borrowers continued to ease through july but remained modestly tight—close to pre pandemic averages  however  the volumes of both home purchase and refinance mortgage originations plunged in july amid rising mortgage rates  consumer credit remained available to most households in june and july  but about half of the respondents in the federal reserve bank of new york s survey of consumer expectations indicated that it was harder to obtain credit than it was a year earlier and that they expected it to become even harder over the next year   the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained generally strong  with low default rates for both corporate bonds and leveraged loans  the volume of rating upgrades in the corporate bond market outpaced that of downgrades in july and august  but  so far in september  these relative volumes reversed  the volume of rating downgrades in the leveraged loan market continued to exceed that of upgrades  credit quality for c i and cre loans on banks  balance sheets also remained sound  as delinquency rates remained at low levels through june  however  banks increased loan loss provisions somewhat in the second quarter  delinquency rates on cre loans securitized into cmbs remained unchanged in july  delinquency rates on small business loans stayed quite low after edging up  and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong   household credit quality stayed broadly solid but continued to worsen for some types of credit owed by borrowers with low credit scores  mortgage delinquencies trended down in recent months  and the share of mortgages in foreclosure remained low in july  by contrast  credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose over the second quarter  particularly among subprime borrowers  with subprime auto loan delinquency rates rebounding notably to slightly above their historical averages   staff economic outlook  the projection for u s  economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was slightly weaker than the july forecast  however  the staff s estimate of potential output in recent history was revised down significantly in response to continued disappointing productivity growth and the sluggish gains in labor force participation seen so far this year  moreover  this lower trajectory for potential output was expected to persist throughout the forecast period  as a result  the staff s estimate of the output gap was revised up considerably this year  and while the staff projection still had the output gap closing in coming years  the level of output was expected to be slightly above potential at the end of   likewise  the unemployment rate was expected to rise more slowly than in the july projection and to be slightly below the staff s estimate of its natural rate at the end of    on a  month change basis  total pce price inflation was expected to be   percent in   and core inflation was expected to be   percent  although the staff continued to project that core inflation would step down over the next two years—reflecting the anticipated resolution of supply–demand imbalances and a labor market that was expected to become less tight—core inflation was revised up in each year of the projection  in   core inflation was expected to be   percent  total pce price inflation was expected to decline to   percent in  as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined  total pce inflation was expected to move down further in   to  percent  and to remain at  percent in    the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside  in addition to russia s war in ukraine  weakening activity abroad  and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks  the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater than assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity  the staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside on the grounds that supply conditions might not improve as much as expected and energy prices might rise sharply again  the staff also pointed to the possibility that wage increases could put a greater than expected amount of upward pressure on price inflation and the possibility that inflation expectations could become unanchored given the large rise in inflation seen over the past year as additional upside risks to the inflation forecast   participants  views on current conditions and the economic outlook  in conjunction with this fomc meeting  participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth  the unemployment rate  and inflation for each year from  through  and over the longer run  based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy  including the path of the federal funds rate  the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge  over time  under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy  a summary of economic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting   in their discussion of current economic conditions  participants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production  job gains had been robust in recent months  and the unemployment rate had remained low  inflation remained elevated  reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic  higher food and energy prices  and broader price pressures  participants recognized that russia s war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship  participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity  against this background  participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks   with regard to the economic outlook  participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year  participants observed that recent indicators of consumer spending and business investment suggested modest increases in those spending categories but noted that activity in interest sensitive sectors weakened appreciably  participants revised down their projections of real gdp growth for this year from their projections in june  several participants noted that the continued strength in the labor market  as well as the data on gross domestic income  raised the possibility that the current gdp data could understate the strength in economic activity this year  participants generally anticipated that the u s  economy would grow at a below trend pace in this and the coming few years  with the labor market becoming less tight  as monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance and global headwinds persisted  participants noted that a period of below trend real gdp growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability   in their discussion of the household sector  participants noted that consumer spending grew moderately  reflecting strength in the labor market  the elevated level of household savings accumulated during the pandemic  and a strong aggregate household sector balance sheet  several participants noted that spending appeared to have held up relatively well  especially among higher income households  these participants also noted that the composition of spending by low to moderate income households—who were affected to a greater degree by high food  energy  and shelter prices—was changing  with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lower cost options  participants observed that the notable slowdown in residential investment and other interest sensitive spending had continued  reflecting the effect of the committee s monetary policy actions and tighter financial conditions   with regard to the business sector  participants observed that growth in investment spending appeared modest  several participants mentioned that manufacturing activity had slowed  a couple of participants noted that businesses were constrained in undertaking new capital projects  as they faced higher financing costs  persistent challenges associated with supply bottlenecks  and hiring difficulties resulting from the continued tightness of the labor market   participants discussed how they perceived challenging supply conditions to be evolving  many participants remarked that their business contacts were reporting signs of relief in supply bottlenecks  such as declines in shipping costs and delivery times and rising inventories  while several participants saw little improvement in the supply situation  participants saw supply bottlenecks as likely continuing for a while longer  and a couple commented that constraints on production were increasingly taking the form of labor shortages rather than parts shortages   participants observed that the labor market had remained very tight  as evidenced by a historically low unemployment rate  elevated job vacancies and quit rates  a low pace of layoffs  robust employment gains  and high nominal wage growth  a few participants remarked that employers facing particularly acute labor shortages were those associated with professional occupations  service industries  skilled trades  and smaller firms  some participants noted a number of developments consistent with the labor market moving toward better balance  including a lower rate of job turnover  a moderation in employment growth  and an increase in the labor force participation rate for prime age workers  however  several participants assessed that the scope for further improvement in labor force participation was likely limited  especially in view of the sizable contribution that retirements had made to the previous decline in the participation rate   participants anticipated that the supply and demand imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish and the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat  importantly reflecting the effects of tighter monetary policy  participants judged that a softening in the labor market would be needed to ease upward pressures on wages and prices  participants expected that the transition toward a softer labor market would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate  several commented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation  a couple of participants remarked that  in light of challenges in hiring  businesses might be less willing to reduce their staffing levels in the event of a weakening in general economic activity  a few participants particularly stressed the high uncertainty associated with the expected future path of the unemployment rate and commented that the unemployment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast   participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the committee s longer run goal of  percent  participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that  correspondingly  inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating  price pressures had remained elevated and had persisted across a broad array of product categories  energy prices had declined in recent months but remained considerably higher than in   and upside risks to energy prices remained  several participants noted the continued elevated rates of increase in core goods prices  these participants considered this development as potentially indicating that the shift of household spending from goods to services might be having a smaller effect on goods prices than they expected or that the supply bottlenecks and labor shortages were taking longer to be resolved  participants commented that they expected inflation pressures to persist in the near term  numerous contributing factors were cited as supporting this view  including labor market tightness and the resulting upward pressure on nominal wages  continuing supply chain disruptions  and the persistent nature of increases in services prices  particularly shelter prices   with respect to the medium term  participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in coming years  various factors were cited as likely to contribute to this outcome  including the committee s tightening of its policy stance  a gradual easing of supply and demand imbalances in labor and product markets  and the likelihood that weaker consumer demand would result in a reduction of business profit margins from their current elevated levels  a few participants reported that business contacts in certain retail sectors—such as used cars and apparel—were planning to cut prices in order to help reduce their inventories  several participants commented that while households across the income distribution were burdened by elevated inflation  those at the lower end of the income distribution were particularly harmed  as a larger share of their income was spent on housing and other necessities   in assessing inflation expectations  participants noted that longer term expectations appeared to remain well anchored  as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households  businesses  and forecasters as well as measures obtained from financial markets  participants remarked that the committee s affirmation of its strong commitment to its price stability objective  together with its forceful policy actions  had likely helped keep longer run inflation expectations anchored  some stressed that a more prolonged period of elevated inflation would increase the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored  making it much more costly to bring inflation down  a few participants discussed the increased dispersion of longer term inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys  with an increase in the number of respondents reporting relatively low expectations of future inflation acknowledged as a key driver of the increased dispersion but with a couple of participants citing higher inflation expectations among some survey respondents as a cause for concern and a reason not to be complacent about longer term inflation expectations remaining well anchored   participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that risks to their inflation outlook were weighted to the upside  some participants noted rising labor tensions  a new round of global energy price increases  further disruptions in supply chains  and a larger than expected pass through of wage increases into price increases as potential shocks that  if they materialized  could compound an already challenging inflation problem  a number of participants commented that a wage–price spiral had not yet developed but cited its possible emergence as a risk   participants broadly judged the risks to real gdp growth to be weighted to the downside  with various global headwinds most prominently cited as contributing factors  these global headwinds included heightened risk of recession in europe  a slowdown in economic activity occurring in china  and the ongoing global economic implications of russia s war against ukraine  several participants noted that the monetary policy tightening under way in many other economies would affect global financial markets and foreign real gdp growth  with the potential for spillovers to the u s  economy   in their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy  participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the committee s  percent inflation objective  participants observed that recent indicators of production and spending had pointed to modest growth  while job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low  against this backdrop  all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate  basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings  as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet that the committee issued in may  policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the committee s monetary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to  percent  participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committee s  percent objective  with many stressing the importance of staying on this course even as the labor market slowed   in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings  participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committee s objectives  participants judged that the committee needed to move to  and then maintain  a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the committee s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability  many participants noted that  with inflation well above the committee s  percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating  and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing  they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the committee s goals  participants judged that the pace and extent of policy rate increases would continue to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook for economic activity and inflation and on risks to the outlook  several participants noted that  particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environment  it would be important to calibrate the pace of further policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook  participants observed that  as the stance of monetary policy tightened further  it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation  many participants indicated that  once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level  it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to return to the  percent objective  participants noted that  in keeping with the committee s plans for reducing the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet  balance sheet runoff had moved up to its maximum planned pace in september and would continue at that pace  they further observed that a significant reduction in the committee s holdings of securities was in progress and that this process was contributing to the move to a restrictive policy stance  a couple of participants remarked that  after the process of balance sheet reduction was well under way  it would be appropriate for the committee to consider sales of agency mbs in order to enable suitable progress toward a longer run soma portfolio composed primarily of treasury securities   in their assessment of the effects of policy actions and communications to date  participants concurred that the committee s actions to raise expeditiously the target range for the federal funds rate demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to  percent and to keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with that longer run goal  participants noted that the committee s commitment to restoring price stability  together with its purposeful policy actions and communications  had contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions over the past year that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand  participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial increases in real interest rates across the maturity spectrum  most participants remarked that  al\\xadthough some interest sensitive categories of spending—such as housing and business fixed investment—had already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions  a sizable portion of economic activity had yet to display much response  they noted also that inflation had not yet responded appreciably to policy tightening and that a significant reduction in inflation would likely lag that of aggregate demand  participants observed that a period of real gdp growth below its trend rate  very likely accompanied by some softening in labor market conditions  was required  they agreed that  by moving its policy purposefully toward an appropriately restrictive stance  the committee would help ensure that elevated inflation did not become entrenched and that inflation expectations did not become unanchored  these policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation  including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability   in light of the broad based and unacceptably high level of inflation  the intermeeting news of higher than expected inflation  and upside risks to the inflation outlook  participants remarked that purposefully moving to a restrictive policy stance in the near term was consistent with risk management considerations  many participants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action  several participants underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary  with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation  several participants observed that as policy moved into restrictive territory  risks would become more two sided  reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in aggregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to  percent  a few of these participants noted that this possibility was heightened by factors beyond the committee s actions  including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook  that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead   committee policy action  in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting  members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production  members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low  members agreed that inflation remained elevated  reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic  higher food and energy prices  and broader price pressures   members observed that russia s war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship  they also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity  members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks   in their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the committee s maximum employment and price stability goals  the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to  to    percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate  in addition  members agreed that the committee would continue reducing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs  as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet issued in may   members agreed that  in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals  they also noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information  including readings on public health  labor market conditions  inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and financial and international developments  members affirmed that the committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its  percent objective   at the conclusion of the discussion  the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new

both a slowdown in customer traffic and smaller purchases per visit   auto dealers reported little change to the weak level of sales observed during the prior period  and sales remain significantly

but remains well below  levels  bookings for domestic leisure travel remained strong  particularly at shore and resort locations  however  one contact noted that the amount of money guests spend at

relative to past years   loan volumes continued to grow at a moderate pace for home mortgages  with multiple contacts noting an increase in volume of adjustable rate mortgages  volumes also grew

balance  though it varied considerably by sector  on the one hand  contacts said that higher interest rates dampened demand in rate sensitive sectors such as automobile sales  residential real estate  and nonresidential construction  on the other hand  manufacturers experienced increased demand with some reportedly benefitting from inventory replenishment and easing supply chain disruptions  which have not yet normalized   and professional and business services firms reported further increases in demand from already high levels  looking forward  firms were generally more pessimistic about the near term outlook than during the prior reporting period  a situation which likely contributed to lowered capital spending plans as well  labor demand was solid  although fewer contacts reported adding staff to their payrolls than in the previous period  while cost and price pressures remained high  contacts again reported modest relief in recent weeks   labor markets  employment continued to increase  albeit at a slower pace  slower employment growth in recent cycles is mostly a function of fewer firms adding to their staffing levels and more holding steady  a much larger share of contacts  roughly  percent  on average  indicated that staffing levels were unchanged in the september october timeframe  compared to the share in the first quarter  when roughly  percent reported the same  one logistics contact said   we would normally be hiring more people at this time but economic uncertainty has put our expansion plans on hold   a small   percent  but increased share of

contacts said that labor markets are still tight and likely to remain so  keeping upward pressure on wages for the near future   prices  cost pressures remained high  though they eased further in recent weeks  the share of contacts reporting higher costs was unchanged from the prior reporting period  but the share reporting a decline in input costs was at its highest in more than two years  among the latter was a national retailer who said that product costs were still high  but lower than in the early spring and summer  freight costs  which have been a pain point for most firms  continued to fall  in many cases in which firms  overall input costs rose  the rate of increase slowed  as one manufacturer stated   material prices have leveled off and we are not seeing the large increases we were seeing in the first and second quarters    selling price pressures remained elevated though they too lessened further recently  the share of contacts reporting an increase in selling prices dipped below  percent for the first time since april   however  the relief was uneven  one manufacturer acknowledged that the firm was raising prices for smaller customers more so than for large companies  and a freight hauler noted that prices were falling in some regions while rising in others  in addition  a national discount retailer said that prices had come down in areas where demand had fallen  even as its costs remained higher   consumer spending  retailers reported weaker sales as consumers cautiously managed their budgets because of rising food and gas prices  one general merchandiser noted consumers continued trading down on items  most recently to canned goods from fresh foods  on balance  restauranteurs and tourism contacts reported that sales increased from those during the summer months  still  some reported guest counts had slowed  and that consumers had less spending power because of inflation  auto dealers reported flat or decreasing sales  noting that consumers had become wary of higher payments because of increased interest rates and higher vehicle prices   manufacturing   on balance  demand for manufactured goods strengthened  with several contacts noting that sales had increased compared with those of previous months  some reportedly benefitted from inventory replenishment and easing supply chain disruptions  still  the largest share of contacts said demand was unchanged  supply chain disruptions persisted  and while some contacts indicated that these disruptions had eased somewhat  they remained far from normal  manufacturers  expectations for the coming months were mixed  with some expecting continued easing of supply chain issues that would boost demand and others predicting a decline in activity   real estate and construction  residential construction and real estate activity declined further as interest rates increased and buyer confidence weakened  one real estate agent noted that increased mortgage rates have greatly impacted entry level homebuyers  while declines in the stock market have reduced the amount of funds available for higher income homebuyers  residential construction contacts reported that new home sales also continued to fall  one homebuilder stated that   i think we are seeing the downturn we have been expecting and hearing of elsewhere for some time   contacts did not expect demand to recover anytime soon because interest rates were expected to continue rising   demand for nonresidential construction and real estate also weakened amid rising interest rates and elevated construction costs  one general contractor noted that his firm s clients have begun to delay plans for new projects as interest rates and inflation continued to rise  despite a slowdown in construction and sales activity  leasing activity has remained strong  particularly for industrial space  going forward  contacts anticipated demand would continue to decline as interest rates increase further and consumers reduce spending   financial services  overall growth in lending stalled during the reporting period  while bankers noted that commercial lending remained strong

commercial and consumer loans were still low  although a few bankers noted a slight uptick in delinquencies on auto and small business loans  contacts reported that consumer deposit balances decreased slightly  and some bankers indicated that customers were moving deposits to higher yield accounts  bankers expected overall loan demand to decline in the near term because of interest rate expectations   nonfinancial services  demand for professional and business services remained strong while demand for freight services weakened further  professional and business services firms reported that demand for digital authentication services and software solutions remained robust  in particular  one contact noted an increased need for fraud prevention systems  contacts anticipated demand for their firms  products and services would remain strong going forward  freight contacts reported a decline in demand and overall orders  one freight contact attributed the softening in demand to clients having caught up on their order backlogs  freight firms expected demand will decline further   community conditions  according to a semiannual survey of nonprofit service providers

contributed to the decline in financial wellbeing  with one respondent stating that higher prices  caused families to make different decisions regarding expenses  particularly food and travel   several contacts noted that affordable housing options were being lost to out of town investors who were buying existing rental properties and increasing rents  in eastern kentucky  contacts noted that the scarcity in affordable housing was exacerbated by july s flood  job availability remained elevated even though a slightly higher share of survey respondents indicated that it had eased
